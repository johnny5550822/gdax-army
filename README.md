# Repo Notes
- we should only keep one single straight global/master history (i.e., we can branch in local, but not in global/master.)
- please follow as close as pep-0008 for coding (https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/), such as having at most 79 characters in a line
- REMEMBER to remove your credentials in code and online everytime before you push to master branch. 
- Code in pythonic way. 
- We follow KISS (Keep it simple, stupid!) for the design principle, and OOP for design pattern.
- Try to look for a good design pattern, e.g., facade
